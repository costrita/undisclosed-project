#### Core Features and AI Capabilities

Inpulse is an all-in-one AI platform for back-office ops, emphasizing automation, collaboration, and real-time insights. It's SaaS-based, with quick setup (under 1 hour) and offline mode for on-the-go use. No public pricing—it's subscription-based, customized by features and site count (likely €50-200/month per location, based on similar tools, but confirm via demo if needed).

Key features:

- **Sales Forecasting and Demand Prediction**: AI analyzes historical data, weather, holidays, events (e.g., sports, JO Paris), and local factors for up to 95% accuracy on sales and product mix. This auto-generates production plans (e.g., how many baguettes or sandwiches to bake).
- Order Automation: Recommends exact supplier orders to avoid over/under-stocking, integrates with POS for real-time tracking.
- Profitability Analytics: Real-time dashboards for food costs, margins, waste, and variances (theoretical vs. actual consumption). Exports data easily for teams.
- Standardization and Training: AI helps onboard new staff/franchisees by standardizing processes, cutting training time.

AI is the star: It processes complex data for "data-driven decisions," outperforming manual or basic software by factoring in externals like météo for demand spikes.
