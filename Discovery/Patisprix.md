# meeting at serbotel
We met with the CEO of the app. This is a couple (husband and wife). We talked with the wife. She worked in boulangerie for decades so she knows exactly the business. What they did is, including a set of well-known, always used recipes directly in the app. (This is a software btw, no web app). And the boulanger can tweak the recettes to adapt the final proposed price. They claim that they can increase the margins of the boulangerie to 75%. 75% is known to be in the top end for boulangeries in general. Apparently in the "algorithm" which is used to calculate the final price, the headcount cost is also included. 

While the idea is probably great, they are rather new and it's hard to estimate if they have a real impact in the industry.

Based on Titouan's feedback, changing the prices, is something which is very difficult and nearly impossible to do in the real world of boulangerie.

### Their pricing model
The pricing is a one time payment of 750 to 1000 euros, interesting approach, compared to the competition. They claim that the boulanger don't like to pay sub based solutions but rather prefer a one time payment.

### Marketing model
@Dorian really liked the bande desinnee approach (see their prospectus [[Flyers]])
