# Goals for Serbotel

[[Exhibitor Research]] [[Schedule and Logistics]]

## Primary Objectives
- Validate a niche problem: Confirm 1-2 high-pain IT issues in boulangeries (e.g., over-purchasing ingredients, poor profitability tracking) via 10+ conversations.
- Network: Collect 20+ contacts (boulangerie owners, tech exhibitors) for follow-up interviews or beta testing.
- Inspiration: Identify how AI can enhance tools like Otami (e.g., predictive analytics for waste reduction).
- Competitive Intel: Spot software providers in bakery management—note gaps we can fill.

## Daily Targets
- Day 1 (Oct 19): Focus on boulangerie exhibitors and opening conferences.
- Day 2 (Oct 20): Attend IT/digital sessions; interview 5+ owners.
- Day 3 (Oct 21): Competitions/demos—observe real workflows for AI ideas.
- Day 4 (Oct 22): Wrap-up networking; pitch to 3 potential advisors.

## Success Metrics
- 70% of interviewees confirm a problem we'd solve.
- 5+ leads interested in our concept.
- Notes on 3+ tech trends (e.g., digital invoicing tools).
