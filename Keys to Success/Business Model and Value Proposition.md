    - Subscription-based (SaaS), transaction fees, or a freemium model? Consider what bakeries can afford and what aligns with industry norms.
- **What are the initial and ongoing costs?**
    - Estimate development costs for the web app, AI integration, cloud hosting, and marketing. Factor in your and Alex’s time and expertise.
- **What’s the scalability potential?**
    - Can the app expand to other regions or industries (e.g., restaurants, cafes)? How will it adapt to varying bakery sizes or needs?
