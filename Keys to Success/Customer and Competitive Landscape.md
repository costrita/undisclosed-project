- **Who are our competitors, and how do we differentiate?**
    - Analyze Otami and other platforms (e.g., Lightspeed, Square, or local French solutions). What makes your app uniqueâ€”AI features, pricing, or bakery-specific focus?
- **What do bakery owners value most?**
    - Is it ease of use, cost savings, time efficiency, or customer retention? Conduct interviews or surveys with bakery owners to validate assumptions.
- **How will we reach and acquire customers?**
    - Will you use digital marketing, partnerships with bakery associations, or trade shows like _Europain_? Define a go-to-market strategy.
