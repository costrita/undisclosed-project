23. **What metrics will define success?**
    - Number of active bakeries, monthly revenue, user retention, or AI-driven efficiency gains? Set measurable goals.
24. **How will we incorporate customer feedback into the product?**
    - Establish a process for collecting and acting on bakery owner input to refine the app.
