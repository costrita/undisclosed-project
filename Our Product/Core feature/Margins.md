## How to optimize margins

Based on historical data on sales and price, AI can suggest "elastic" pricing based on previous sale.

Example: We know, from previous year's data, that in October 2024 the cookie "Alpha" had a spike in selling volume. We also know that this cookie "Alpha" represents 5% of CA (turnover) and 18% of total margins. With this data, AI will suggest to the boulanger to "sell more" or setup this product more in the light, in October 2025. 

There are 2 fundamental ideas:
	1. AI suggestions on how much I should sell, in a given period of time, the product "Beta" based on its previous performance (margin) and selling volume (spikes)
	2. AI suggestions on what exact product should be considered more often based on its overall margin. As said some products have more or less margin out of the total pool of margin, providing this insight on which product should be preferred for the next month/quarter is essential to have higher overall margin.

Open point:
	- Would it be possible to connect the POS for dynamic volume prediction? Example: if the AI notices an unusual +15% spike in consumption, it notifies the boulanger about it, with an action point, make X croissants.
