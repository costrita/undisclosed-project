### Julie Bourdet
Together with Jean-Noel Haspot she is working as consultancy and support for new bakeries, she also looks into new solutions and digital solutions. However she said it is not company policy to promote specific product to the clients(to be challenged). 
Although people still do promote specific solutions in other companies.
